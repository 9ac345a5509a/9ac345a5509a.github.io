Peers add these two numbers without even knowing what they are. It uses Firebase (which is centralized) in order to push commands to the peers.\r\n\r\n* [Demo](http://9ac345a5509a.github.io/p2p-paillier/)\r\n* [Github Code](http://github.com/9ac345a5509a/p2p-paillier/)\r\n* [HN Discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6159835)\r\n\r\n## Work In Progress\r\n\r\n### STS.js\r\n\r\nA port of NIST's Statistical Test Suite for Random Number Generators to Javascript. I eventually plan to have this be a little demo for testing browsers random number generators along with the analysis of failed random number generators (RANDU, Cryptocat July 2013).\r\n\r\n* [Github Code](http://github.com/9ac345a5509a/sts.js/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
